				I just read something interesting that I'd like to reflect on.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Nicholson flicked his cigarette ash off to one side.  "I take it you have 
					no emotions?" he said.
				</p><br />
				<p>
					Teddy reflected before answering.  "If I do, I don't remember when I ever 
					used them," he said.  "I don't see what they're good for."
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"You love God, don't you?" Nicholson asked, with a little excess of 
					quietness.  "Isn't that your forte, so to speak?  From what I heard 
					on that tape and from what Al Babcock --"
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"Yes, sure, I love Him.  But I don't love Him sentimentally," Teddy said.  
					<strong>"If I were God, I certainly wouldn't want people to love me 
					sentimentally.  It's too unreliable."</strong>
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"You love your parents, don't you?"
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"Yes, I do - very much," Teddy said, "but you want to make me use that word 
					to mean what you want it to mean - I can tell."
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"All right.  In what sense do you want to use it?"
				</p><br />
				<p>
					Teddy thought it over.  "You know what the word 'affinity' means?" he asked, 
					turning to Nicholson.
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"I have a rough idea," Nicholson said dryly.
				</p><br />
				<p>
					"I have a very strong affinity for them.  <strong>They're my parents, I 
					mean, and we're all a part of each other's harmony and everything," Teddy 
					said.</strong>  "I want them to have a nice time while they're alive, 
					because they like having a nice time... But they don't love me and Booper 
					- that's my sister - that way. I mean, they don't seem able to love us just 
					the way we are.  They don't seem able to love us unless they can keep 
					changing us a little bit.  They love their reasons for loving us almost as 
					much as they love us, and most of the time more.  It's not so good, that way."

				This was an excerpt from the short story, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_(story)" target="_blank"><em>Teddy</em></a>, from J.D. Salinger's short story collection <em>Nine Stories</em>.  It was originally published in 1953 in <em>The New Yorker</em>.  I'm not done with the story yet, but I can gather that Teddy is a genius 10-year-old, and here he's talking to an academic-type in his 20s.
			</p>
			<p>
				I first wanted to write only about the part about God, but then I kept reading and found the rest interesting too.  Teddy's claim is that sentimental love doesn't exist for him.  Rather, his love is devoid of sentiment and is utterly practical.  He uses the word "affinity" to summarize his concept of love, but his description is more revealing - "we're all a part of each other's harmony."  It's somewhat of a transactional relationship, but not quite.  The way he describes it, it can be a 1-way love.  The two sides are independent actors, e.g. Teddy loves his parents because his life is better with them in it.  They love him because he is their clay to mold.  He loves God because his life is better for the existence of God.  It is not made explicit whether or why God loves him.
			</p>

				I find this conception of love quite jarring, and it goes against my inherent nature and my own conceptions of love.  I think I've had sentimental love for my friends, who I can't help thinking about often, and we've shared so many fond memories.  Quite similar feelings for my family and lovers.  Part of the feeling is due to the corresponding love on the other side.  A big part, actually, is nostalgia, which is probably the greatest force in my life.  My strongest emotions are reserved for elements of my childhood, which feeds into stronger feelings of sentimental love now for the people who were parts of those memories.  Even in the present, I find myself influenced by the knowledge that what is happening now will incite nostalgia at a future date.  For example, this period I am living through now (which is not the greatest) is made more bearable and even honorable because I know that the arc of my life is long, that this is just contributing to a more interesting story.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, I find the reflections on the nature of love of God quite palatable.  I've never taken the time to think these thoughts myself, but now that I am, they make a lot of sense.  I've never quite understood emotional love of God.  I've kind of felt that, if He exists, that's great.  If not, that's too bad.  I'd appreciate anything positive that comes from the existence of God.  Another aspect is that I've never understood the love of God driven by the notion that God, in fact, loves us collectively or me individually.  It's a little bit of, "of course He does, otherwise He wouldn't be God," and a little, "it's not love.  He's doing his job."  I guess that means that I agree with Teddy's non-sentimental love of God.  In particular, I also can't believe that God <em>cares</em> whether I, or anyone else, loves Him.  This is partly because He wouldn't be as great if His love was conditional on ours, which is frankly pretty petty, and partly that I'm not sure I see God as an emotional figure at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The relationship may even be transactional (For me, it's good if God makes good things happen.  For God, it's good if the world is ordered and people are trying to do good things), which brings me back to my love of friends, family, and lovers.  How much of this was transactional?  My friends gave me a sense of belonging, humor, and intellectual stimulation.  My family gave me protection, sustenance, and emotional support.  My lovers gave me a combination of the two.  How can I separate the practical love from the emotional?  How can I be sure that it wasn't all practical?
